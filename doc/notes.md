# 1. Introduction  

1. For anomaly detection task, building hand-engineered features requires a great amount of domain knowledge, reconstruction based method is easier to use.
2. Execllent way to intergrate time series analysis wtih multi-variable analysis.
3. Could give some intuition into each and every variable, for example, help people understand which variable is anomalous.
4. Any kind of AE can introduce non-linearity into the model, a feature that the current anomaly detection model on Microsoft Azure does not possess.


# 2. Issues List  
1. Find a  way  so that the model can be robust to missing points in the dataset.
